This package helps you build administrative CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve,
Update, Delete) into your web site, as Yesod subsites. There is a demo site in
the `example` directory in the distribution.

![Screenshot from the example CRUD subsite](example/crud-example-users.png)

To begin, add subsites to your `routes` file, like these:

```
/users         UserCrudR  CrudSubsite-UserCrud  mkUserCrud
/pubs/#UserId  PubCrudR   CrudSubsite-PubCrud   mkPubCrud
```

Now, in your Foundation module, you must define the subsite foundation types
and functions. Here we have one foundation type that is nullary, and another
that carries a piece of data.

```haskell
data UserCrud = UserCrud
mkUserCrud :: a -> CrudSubsite UserCrud
mkUserCrud _ = CrudSubsite UserCrud

data PubCrud = PubCrud UserId
mkPubCrud :: a -> UserId -> CrudSubsite PubCrud
mkPubCrud _ = CrudSubsite . PubCrud
```

Next, define the type families on which these will operate. The simplest case
is that `ObjId` is a Persistent database `Key` and `Obj` is one of your model
types, but yesod-crud supports other types and non-Persistent databases too.

```haskell
instance CrudTypes UserCrud where
  type Site UserCrud = App
  type ObjId UserCrud = UserId
  type Obj UserCrud = User

instance CrudTypes PubCrud where
  type Site PubCrud = App
  type ObjId PubCrud = PublicationId
  type Obj PubCrud = Publication
```

The above generally must go within the `Foundation.hs` of a scaffolded site,
because it relies on the `App` type, and is in turn used in the routes file.
The remaining CRUD operations can be defined elsewhere and then imported into
`Application.hs` for the dispatcher to access.

```haskell
instance RenderMessage (CrudSubsite UserCrud) CrudMessage where
  renderMessage _ _ CrudMsgEntity = "User"
  renderMessage _ _ CrudMsgEntities = "Users"
  renderMessage _ _ m = defaultCrudMessage m

instance Crud UserCrud where
  crudDB = return crudPersistDefaults
  crudShow = return . userIdent
  crudEq u v = return $ u == v
  crudMakeForm uOpt =
    return $ renderDivs $ User
    <$> areq textField "User name" (userIdent <$> uOpt)
    <*> aopt passwordField "Password" (userPassword <$> uOpt)
```

The minimal definition above will provide pages to list users, add a new user,
update existing users, and delete users (with a confirmation step). Various
aspects of the look and functionality can be overridden, and the CRUD widgets
can be mixed and matched on other pages too.
